### Summary

Visualizing pickup and dropoff zones to identify high volume areas led to common-sense conclusions: high traffic areas include Manhattan 
and the Airports, and low traffic areas include Brooklyn and Long Island.
Analysis of Tipping Data revealed very little. Data reveals a slight but not significant negative relationship between the distance of a 
ride and the tip percentage, and basically no relationship between the pickup time, measured from 0-1 representing a 24 hr clock, and tip 
percentage. 
However, grouping by number of passengers reveals more interesting information. The column of 8 passengers has too few data points to be 
significant. However, groups of 6 and 7 tip substantially better than smaller groups. The common-sense response to this observation would 
be to conclude that limo drivers get better tips. Groups of 2 also tipped better than the average which, totally speculative,
might be a factor of people on dates.
